# Project Plan: Solana dApp with React Frontend and Flask Backend

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to send and receive tokens on the Solana blockchain. The application will have a **React** frontend and a **Flask** backend. Both components will be in the same repository and will be designed to communicate seamlessly.

---

## Features
### Core Features
1. **User Wallet Integration**:
   - Connect a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare).
   - Display wallet address and balance.

2. **Token Transactions**:
   - Send tokens from one wallet to another.
   - Fetch and display transaction history.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - Show the current balance of the connected wallet.

4. **Blockchain Interaction**:
   - Use Solana’s Web3.js library in the frontend for wallet interactions.
   - Use the backend for validating transactions and additional security.

5. **CRUD Functionality**:
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete user profiles.
   - Log and manage transaction records (add, view, update, and delete entries).

### Stretch Goals
1. **Multiple Token Support**:
   - Add support for SPL tokens.

2. **Transaction Notifications**:
   - Notify users of transaction success or failure.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Optional backend authentication for user session management.

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add animations and responsive design for a better user experience.
5. Input Search  
- As a user, I want the ability to **search for other tokens**.  
- As a user, I want to see **price changes for Solana and other tokens**.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React (with Vite for setup)
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS or Material UI
- **Solana Integration**: Solana Web3.js library
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (for logging transactions or optional user data)
- **API Interaction**: Flask REST API
- **Blockchain Integration**: Solana’s Python SDK or RPC calls

## Communication Between Frontend and Backend
1. **API Endpoints in Flask**:
   - `POST /send`: Handles sending tokens.
   - `GET /balance`: Fetches wallet balance.
   - `POST /profiles`: Creates a new user profile.
   - `GET /profiles/<id>`: Retrieves a specific user profile.
   - `PUT /profiles/<id>`: Updates a specific user profile.
   - `DELETE /profiles/<id>`: Deletes a specific user profile.
   - `GET /transactions`: Retrieves all transaction logs.
   - `POST /transactions`: Creates a new transaction log.
   - `PUT /transactions/<id>`: Updates a specific transaction log.
   - `DELETE /transactions/<id>`: Deletes a specific transaction log.

2. **HTTP Requests in React**:
   - Use `axios` or `fetch` to interact with the Flask backend.
   - Set up environment variables for the backend URL.

3. **CORS**:
   - Since both the frontend and backend will be in the same repository and served together, CORS won’t be required. However, it can be added for flexibility during development.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Environment
- Initialize the repository and folder structure.
- Set up Flask backend with a simple `app.py`.
- Create a React app using Vite.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Implement the Flask routes for sending tokens and checking balances.
- Implement CRUD operations for user profiles and transaction logs.
- Integrate Solana’s Python SDK for blockchain interaction.
- Test API endpoints using Postman or Curl.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Set up wallet connection using Solana Web3.js.
- Build the UI components:
  - Wallet connection button
  - Send token form
  - Balance display
  - CRUD interfaces for user profiles and transaction logs
- Integrate the frontend with Flask API endpoints.

### Phase 4: Integration
- Serve the React app through Flask for a unified deployment.
- Test the end-to-end flow: wallet connection, token sending, CRUD operations, and balance checking.

### Phase 5: Final Touches
- Add styling and polish the UI.
- Write documentation in `README.md`.
- Optional: Add stretch goal features.

# User Stories  

## Authentication  
- As a user, I want to **sign up or log in** to my account so I can access my Solana wallet profile securely.  
- As a returning user, I want to **log in quickly** and be directed to my personalized Solana wallet dashboard.  

## Wallet Management  
- As a user, I want to **create or import a Solana wallet** to manage my funds within the dApp.  
- As a user, I want my wallet data to be **securely stored and accessible in the database**.  

## Buy Solana  
- As a user, I want to be directed to a **trusted third-party platform** (e.g., Phantom or Solflare) to buy Solana tokens.  

## Sell Solana  
- As a user, I want to **sell Solana directly** from my wallet and see the transaction logged in my profile.  

## Send Solana  
- As a user, I want to **send Solana** to another wallet by entering the recipient's wallet address.  
- As a user, I want my **sent transactions to be stored and viewable** in my profile.  

## Receive Solana  
- As a user, I want to **receive Solana** by sharing my wallet address and have the incoming transactions reflected in my account balance.  

## User Profile  
- As a user, I want my **Solana wallet profile and transaction history** to be stored in a secure PostgreSQL database so that I can access my data at any time.  
- As a user, I want to be able to **view my transaction logs** for Buy, Sell, Send, and Receive actions.  

## Input Search  
- As a user, I want the ability to **search for other tokens**.  
- As a user, I want to see **price changes for Solana and other tokens**.  


## Deployment Plan
1. **Backend**:
   - Deploy Flask backend using services like Heroku, Vercel, or Render.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Bundle the React app and serve it through Flask’s static folder.

3. **Domain**:
   - Optionally set up a custom domain for the dApp.
